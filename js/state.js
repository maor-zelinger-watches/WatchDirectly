/**
 * state.js — Shared mutable application state.
 *
 * A single object every feature module imports and mutates directly —
 * the same discipline app.js used before it was split, now with one
 * owner file. Fields are grouped by the module that primarily drives
 * them; cross-module reads are expected (e.g. prefetch checks view,
 * views check hasMore).
 *
 * Derived helpers that are pure reads of this state live here too, so
 * modules don't need to reach into each other for them — as do the two
 * cross-cutting mutation helpers: patchVideoEverywhere (one video row,
 * every list that holds a copy) and epoch (the single owner of the app's
 * generation counters).
